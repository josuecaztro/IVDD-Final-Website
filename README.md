# ⛪️ Voice of God - Church Website

## 📕 The Back Story

My dad's church organization isn't so tech-savvy, and I noticed they didn't have a website. I thought this would be a great opportunity to use my skills in full-stack development to construct a website for our church organization. <strong>Although it's a work in progress, the website is hosted LIVE NOW at this link [HERE](https://www.iglesiavozdedios.net)</strong> <code>(or visit www.iglesiavozdedios.net)</code>
