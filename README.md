# ⛪️ Voice of God - Church Website

## 📕 The Back Story

My dad's church organization isn't so tech-savvy, and I noticed they didn't have a website. I thought this would be a great opportunity to use my skills in full-stack development to construct a website for our church organization. <strong>Although it's still a work in progress, you can follow this link [HERE](http://18.119.7.144/) to see the website and how it’s going!</strong>

## 🌟 Features
